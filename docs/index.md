Predictable is a framework for developing and running actuarial cashflow models using python.

!!! warning "Not stable"
    This project is currently under active development and is not suitable for production use.

Predictable is designed to be:

- **Open**: Enabling community contributions and influence over development direction
- **Flexible**: Allowing for a wide range of modelling applications in various parts of the industry
- **Transparent**: Models should be easy to understand and debug
- **Reproducible**: Results should be easily validated and reproduced
- **Fast**: Models should be able to run quickly and efficiently at scale
